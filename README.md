# ATC - Air Traffic Control

The game is based on the ATC Game for Linux by Ed James, UC Berkleey: [edjames@ucbvax.berkeley.edu](mailto:edjames@ucbvax.berkeley.edu), ucbvax!edjames.

## GOAL.

Your goal is to manoeuver safely the planes in your area.

You need to:
* take off planes waiting at runways;
* land the planes at destination runways;
* manoeuver the planes out of destination points at altitude of 36000 feet.

The simulation ends when:
* user requests to exit the simulation;
* a plane collinsion is detected, the collision happend when the distance between two planes are lower then 4 nautic miles and the altitude difference is lower then 1000 feet;
* wrong destintation is reached;
* a plane crash is reported whenever a plane lands in wrong direction.

Scores are sorted in order of the number of planes safe. Suspending a game is not permitted.
