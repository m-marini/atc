The game is based on the ATC Game for Linux by Ed James, UC Berkleey: [edjames@ucbvax.berkeley.edu](mailto:edjames@ucbvax.berkeley.edu), ucbvax!edjames.

## GOAL.

Your goal is to direct safely the planes in your area.

You need to:
* take off planes waiting at runways;
* land the planes at destination runways;
* manoeuver the planes out of destination points at altitude of 36000 feet.

The simulation ends when:
* user requests to exit the simulation;
* a plane collinsion is detected, the collision happend when the distance between two planes are lower then 4 nautic miles and the altitude difference is lower then 1000 feet;
* wrong destintation is reached;
* a plane crash is reported whenever a plane lands in wrong direction.

Scores are sorted in order of the number of planes safe. Suspending a game is not permitted.

## Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
